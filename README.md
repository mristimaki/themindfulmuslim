# The Mindful Muslim

[The Mindful Muslim](https://mristimaki.github.io/themindfulmuslim/) is designed as a motivational platform where I hope to encourage people to be more mindful of their physical and spiritual health. I wanted to create a joyful and straight-to-the-point website, therefore I have made the design simplistic, with bright uplifting colors and with infographic images that gives the visitor a clear picture of what you will find. This platform will provide useful tips that one can implement in their daily life, links to social media platforms that reflects the content of this website, along with quotes from the Quran and Sunnah (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, Peace and Blessings be upon him).

## Visual Design

### Wireframes
Add either printscreens of the wireframes created in the beginning?

### The Fonts
I choosed the fonts for this webdesign via the [fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/all) website.
I chose these particular fonts because I wanted a elegant and clean look to the fonts that complemented the more playful colours in a good way.

### The Colors

To create the playful yet empowering design I wanted, I looked up the emotional effects of colors. I chose the orange colours for the creative, playful and uplifting effects, white for inspiring and fresh look and charcoal for a elegant and empowering effect to the text. 

### The Images

I wanted the images on this website to be simple, informative and straight forward. Therefore I cose these infographics provided by [Sunnah Infographics](https://www.instagram.com/sunnahinfographics/), both to highlight their beautiful work and to encourage the user to visit their platform to gain even more knowledge about the topics provided in The Mindful Muslim. 

### The Icons
Center this image, do I have to make a div class or can I center it some other way?

The icons are taken from the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website.

These are found in the footer for social media links. I wanted the icons to be white and simple in design but with a fun hover effect so that the user may get interested in visiting the social media links provided.
