# The Mindful Muslim

[The Mindful Muslim](https://mristimaki.github.io/themindfulmuslim/) is designed as a motivational platform where I hope to encourage people to be more mindful of their physical and spiritual health. I wanted to create a joyful and straight-to-the-point website, therefore I have made the design simplistic, with bright uplifting colors and with infographic images that gives the visitor a clear picture of what you will find. This platform will provide useful tips that one can implement in their daily life, links to social media platforms that reflects the content of this website, along with quotes from the Quran and Sunnah (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad, Peace and Blessings be upon him).

## Visual Design

### The Fonts
I choosed the fonts for this webdesign via the [fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/all) website.
I chose these particular fonts because I wanted a elegant and clean look to the fonts that complemented the more playful colours in a good way.

### The Colors
<img width="1440" alt="colorpalette" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121927123/219293629-dd4a2324-07b8-4d2f-ae86-cc32ae0dd908.png">

To create the playful yet empowering design I wanted, I looked up the emotional effects of colors. I chose the orange colors for the creative, playful and uplifting effects, white for inspiring and fresh look and charcoal for a elegant and empowering effect to the text. 

### The Images
![images](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121927123/219300505-1679d594-7ae3-49b1-b39c-79504712d968.png)

I wanted the images on this website to be simple, informative and straight forward. Therefore I cose these infographics provided by [Sunnah Infographics](https://www.instagram.com/sunnahinfographics/), both to highlight their beautiful work and to encourage the user to visit their platform to gain even more knowledge about the topics provided in The Mindful Muslim. 

### The Icons

The icons are taken from the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website.

These are found in the footer for social media links.

## Features

### Page Elements

#### Navigation bar
![navbar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121927123/219824183-b010d850-2b13-4ece-8cd2-7e8ff8c2f7b0.png)
The navigation bar is simple and easy to use. I got inspired by this particular [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyaV_EWWRmo) for the design of this navigation bar, I liked the simple clean design and hover effects but made my own design for this particular website. I've styled it so that the active page is highlighted, so that the user easily can see which page they're currently at.

#### Footer
![footer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121927123/219824479-9d741ae3-e11b-4b1a-938d-107c8eeb7301.jpg)
The footer is located at the bottom of every page, with links to different social media platforms. I've used a simple design and a fun hover effect so that the user may get interested in visiting the social media links provided.

#### The landing page
![index html](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121927123/219824853-c63cba71-178b-4bb6-a773-04c4e66c349f.png)
The landing page starts with a simple introduction about the page along with a inspiring quote to get the users attention, I've also linked to a specific podcast episode here, where they mention this quote. The same podcast can be found in the footer aswell. The link becomes a light yellow tone when hovered over.
<br>
Directly after this I've placed three linked images that highlights when hovered over so that the user understands that you can klick it. The images is linked to the Inspiration page where you can learn and read more about these three specific topics presented in the landing page.

## Testing

The design of [The Mindful Muslim](https://mristimaki.github.io/themindfulmuslim/) should be responsive so that when looked at in mobile phones the images should be stacked over each other in Home-page and stacked on top of paragraph in Inspiration-page so that the user can see the images better. The font size in the Inspiration-page also increases on larger devices so that the user can read the text better. I've tested all pages both for mobile and desktop via the **Lighthouse** tool and got these results:
### Mobile 
![LHmobile_home_insp_signup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121927123/219721616-251a0173-bc87-49b2-93d2-2d0e0013c6a3.png)
### Desktop

### General testing
- I have tested my code troughout the buildup with the **inspect** tool to see what impact the code made.
- I have firstly tested if the code works with mobile devices and then checked the outcome on larger devices. 
- I have used my own mobile phone to check if the website works as it is intended. 
- I have used not only the preview but also the deployed website to check if everything works and looks as intended.

### Methods
1. HTML has been validated in the [W3C HTML5 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
2. CSS has been validated in the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
3. Links has been checked in the [W3C Link Checker](https://validator.w3.org/checklink)
4. I've used the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) tutorials and references troughout my project if there was anything that I got stuck on or needed to be reminded of a certain element or tag. 

### Bugs
- The images in homepage would not align as intended in smaller devices. Fixed by changing width on div.
- The border color around the text input when focused did not work. Fixed it by stating outline: none;
- Did not get the navigation bar in header to center (i wrote every css style in same ID a: style). Fixed it by targeting only the ID of nav bar.

### Unfixed bugs
- The footer is not sticking to the bottom of Sign Up-page when screen lagrer than 1450px due to lack of time and knowledge at this point in time.

## Credit and Contact

### Media

- All of the images used is taken from [Sunnah Infographics](https://www.instagram.com/sunnahinfographics/) that creates and shares authentic islamic reminders about islam, balance and wellness.
- I chose [SoulFood FM](https://open.spotify.com/show/1IVH06f51dCWFtwPPVn7zD?si=c452622e04574859&nd=1) as the podcast linked in the social media section since they provide a podcast about spiritual refinement and their episodes are of the shorter kind, therefor it's easier to get these small reminders in to our already busy life.
- I linked the [Yaqeen Institutes](https://www.youtube.com/@yaqeeninstituteofficial) episodes of *["Keys to Prophetic parenting"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqQ_hTtIhQw&list=PLQ02IYL5pmhF5ut07UMO9xqVOP05yh9E5&index=3)* in the social media section since they provide authentic islamic reminders and lectures. I chose the particular episodes about parenting since it is one of the topics in this website and the one that I'm the most passionate about.
