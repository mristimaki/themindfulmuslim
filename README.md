<h1>The Mindful Muslim</h1>
<br>
The Mindful Muslim is a place where I hope to encourage people to be more mindful of their physical and spiritual health. The website is targeted towards both muslims and non muslims who wants to increase in knowledge, get healthier and more mindful in their daily life. The website will provide useful tips that one can implement in their daily life along with quotes from the Quran and Sunnah (sayings of the Prophet Muhammad (Peace and Blessings be upon him).
