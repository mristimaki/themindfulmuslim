                        <br>
                        Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: <i>"There are two blessings that many people are deceived into losing: health and free time."</i>
                        <br>
                        (Sahih al-Bukhari 6412)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <!-- the list dots dissapears if not next to img, also validator says the br element is not allowed as child of element ol, don't like the outcome of not having br -->

                        <li>
                            Walk more.
                            <br>
                            The Prophet ﷺ was very active, would walk long distances and hike to places such as the cave of Hira.
                            Although walking is a very low impact exercise it can have a big inpact on our overall health.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Eat prophetic foods.
                            <br>
                            Stick to eating mostly whole foods, and avoid processed and fried foods. Sunnah foods such as watermelon and cucumber are great hydrating snacks that can fill you up inbetween meals. Pomegranates is also a great snack or addition to your salads that will improve your heart health, exercise endurance and adds antioxidants and vitamins to your meals.
                            Dates are also a important staple that can be used as a natural sweetener to your meals and break your fast with.

                            Do not over eat.
                            <br>
                            The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: <i>"A human being fills no worse vessel than his stomach. It is sufficient for a human being to eat a few mouthfuls to keep his spine straight. But if he must (fill it), then one third of food, one third for drink and one third for air.”</i>
                            <br>
                            (Sunan Ibn Majah 3349, Book 29, Hadith 99)
                            <br>
                            <br>

                        <li>
                            Fast often.
                            <br>
                            Fasting on the Sunnah recommended days of the week: Mondays and Thursdays (Sunan an-Nasa'i 2365) and in the months: 13th, 14th, 15th (Sunan Abi Dawud 2449), can help us to develop the self-dicipline and patience needed to get in to physical ans spiritual shape. 
                            <br>
                            Fasting has been proven to decrease inflammation in the body as well as enhanced heart health.

                <br>
                The Prophet ﷺ said, <i>“Indeed among the believers with the most complete faith is the one who is the best in conduct and the most kind to his family.”</i>
                <br>
                (Sunan At-Tirmizi)

                        Being patient.
                        <br>
                        Anas ibn Malik was a young boy when he had the honour of serving the Prophet ﷺ It is narrated from him that during his ten years of service, the Prophet s.a.w never said a word of impatience or rebuked him. Narrated by Anas r.a himself:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                       <p class="center"> خَدَمْتُ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم عَشْرَ سِنِينَ، فَمَا قَالَ لِي أُفٍّ‏.‏ وَلاَ لِمَ صَنَعْتَ وَلاَ أَلاَّ صَنَعْتَ</p>
                        <br>
                        <i>“I served the Prophet ﷺ for ten years, and he never said to me, "Uff" (a minor harsh word denoting impatience) and never blamed me by saying, "Why did you do so or why didn't you do so?”</i>
                        <br>
                        (Sahih Al-Bukhari)
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A child is bound to err at times but we are to bear with it patiently, whilst advising and guiding them. We shouldn't be constantly admonishing our young ones. 
                        <br>
                        Making supplications or dua for your children is also the prophetic way. It is reported that a parent's supplications for one's children are not rejected by Allah s.w.t.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Make your home a safe space.
                        <br>
                        To feel balanced, we all need a safe place to come home to, both physically and mentally. Fill your home with remembrance of Allah and worship. Declutter and keep your home organized to maximize space for everyone to relax and have fun. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Respecting each other.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p class="center">ما رأيتُ أحدًا كانَ أشبَه سمتًا وَهديًا ودلًّا برسولِ اللَّهِ صلَّى اللَّهُ عليهِ وسلَّمَ من فاطمةَ كانت إذا دخلت عليهِ قامَ إليها فأخذَ بيدِها وقبَّلَها وأجلسَها في مجلسِه وَكانَ إذا دخلَ عليها قامت فأخذت بيدِه فقبَّلتهُ وأجلستهُ في مجلسِها</p>
                        <br>
                        <i>"I have not seen anyone who resembled the Prophet ﷺ in terms of conduct, way, and manners, more than Fatimah". (Aishah continued,) "When the Prophet saw her coming, he would stand up for her, took her hand, kissed her, and brought her to sit in his place. When the Prophet s.a.w visited her, she would stand up for him, take his hand, kiss him and brought him to sit in her place.”</i>
                        <br>
                        (Sunan At-Tirmizi)
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Respecting your child is so important and it must not be forgotten, that respect also includes keeping a child's secrets confidential as well as not humiliating them publicly.

                <h2>Finding Balance</h2>
                <p>The heart relates to our emotional attachments and sentiments, such as love, kindness, affection and caring. The heart is that much closer to our natural instinct, our gut-feeling of what is morally correct and true. As Allah says, it is the hearts that are responsible for our faith. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <i><p class="center">"... verily, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the heart which are in the breasts that grow blind."</p></i>
                <br>
                (Surah Al-Hajj: 46)
                <br>
                <br>
                The Mind is responsible for our logic, rational, knowledge, memory and judgement. We use our minds to grow in knowledge of our religion, the Sunnah and religious rulings so that we can carry out that which is in our hearts.
                <br>
                <br>
                So how can we bring them together?
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul class="circle">
                    <li>
                        Start the day with words of thanks, praise and remembrance of Allah - The Most High
                        <br>
                        <br>

                    <li>
                        Connect with nature, fresh air and natural sunlight have all been shown to boost our mood and alertness at the start of the day, and also help us to naturally wind down and feel tired at the end of the day.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remember Allah in everything that you do throughout the day. Try your best while knowing that Allah will provide for you, maintain a positive outlook and leave that which is outside of your control. 
                        <br>
                        This will help you to achieve a clear mind and heart, making you more productive in your affairs as it is easier to deal with physiological stress as well.

                        End your day as you began with more words of remembrance, take time to reflect on your day and focus on gratitude.
