                       <b>نِعْمَتَانِ مَغْبُونٌ فِيهِما كَثِيرٌ مِنَ النَّاسِ : الصِّحَّةُ والفَراغُ</b>
                        <br>
                        Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The Prophet (ﷺ) said: <i>"There are two blessings that many people are deceived into losing: health and free time."</i>

                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Walk more.
                            <br>
                            The Prophet ﷺ was very active, would walk long distances and hike to places such as the cave of Hira.

                            The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: <i>"A human being fills no worse vessel than his stomach. It is sufficient for a human being to eat a few mouthfuls to keep his spine straight. But if he must (fill it), then one third of food, one third for drink and one third for air.”</i>
